  "The Holden Meteorite changed our world forever when it landed on July 19, 2037.",
  "Alumni Multi National had began preparing nine years earlier.",
  "The Holden Meteorite was first discovered by James Holden, an employee working on BEE's Deep Space Observatory Array in January of 2023. It was not until five years later that a scan of the meteorite revealed heat signatures in the form of living bacteria on the its surface.",
  "We didn't know what to prepare for. So we prepared for everything.",
  "Alumni Multi National, Inc was founded by Dr. Kroto Hawkins. Dr Hawkins, along with over a hundred other scientific leaders from around the world, pulled together funding and began preparing for any possible outcomes the introduction of alien bacteria on Terran soil might produce.",
  "And still, it wasn't enough.",
  "The Holden Meteorite made landfall in the Eastern Hemisphere. The initial impact sent a cloud of dark fungus a hundred meters wide into the air and triggered earthquakes more than a thousand kilometers away."
